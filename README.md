# 2D-radiation-pattern-RW
This code calculates pattern of EM radiation in the far-field region for rectangular waveguide with a cross-section of A x B.

It provides 2D pattern of the EM field distribution at the distance L from the waveguide; and the 1D distributions at the middle axes as well. The calculation is based on the 2D Fourier transform.
